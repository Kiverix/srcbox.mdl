# srcbox model
This is a recreation of the srcbox.mdl model from the INTERLOPER webseries/ARG

To install it, go to your prefered game's root folder
(for ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2\hl2)

Create a folder called "custom" (if its already exists, use that one), then extract the srcbox folder inside the custom folder (file path should be ..\CHOSEN_GAME\custom\srcbox )
